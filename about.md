# About the extension

My name is Dmitry Novikov, `User JavaScript and CSS` extension is a personal and non-commercial project, it has no paid features, advertisements and metrics. The extension is developed on the enthusiasm and support of users.

User JavaScript and CSS is not a replacement for extensions such as Greasemonkey and Stylus, as it does **not yet support** the `GM_API` and `Userstyles API`. It was created with the intention of making it quick and easy to write your own solutions.

### Development plans

- Interface update ✅
- Switch to MV3 ⌛ (in process)
- Firefox support
- Automatic synchronization and support for third-party cloud services
- Open source code on GitHub
- GM_API and Userstyles API support
- And many smaller improvements
